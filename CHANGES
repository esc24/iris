Release 1.2 (unreleased)
========================


Features added
--------------
* Added a convert_units() method to cubes and coordinates for straightforward
  conversion of a cube or coordinate from one unit to another.

Bugs fixed
----------
* N/A

Incompatible changes
--------------------
* The deprecated Cube.unit and Coord.unit attributes has been removed.

Deprecations
------------
* The Coord.unit_converted method has been deprecated. Users should make a
  copy of the coordinate using Coord.copy() and then call the
  convert_units method of the new coordinate.


----------------------------


Release 1.1 (7 Dec, 2012)
==========================


Features added
--------------
* Support for Mac OS X.
* GRIB1 import now supports time units of "3 hours".
* Fieldsfile import now supports unpacked and "CRAY" 32-bit packed data
  in 64-bit Fieldsfiles.
* PP file import now supports "CRAY" 32-bit packed data.
* Various performance improvements, particularly for netCDF import,
  PP import, and constraints.
* GRIB2 export now supports level types of altitude and height
  (codes 102 and 103).
* iris.analysis.cartography.area_weights now supports non-standard
  dimension orders.
* PP file import now adds the "forecast_reference_time" for fields
  where LBTIM is 11, 12, 13, 31, or 32.
* PP file import now supports LBTIM values of 1, 2, and 3.
* Fieldsfile import now has some support for ancillary files.
* Coordinate categorisation functions added for day-of-year and
  user-defined seasons.
* GRIB2 import now has partial support for probability data defined
  with product template 4.9.

Bugs fixed
----------
* PP export no longer attempts to set/overwrite the STASH code based on
  the standard_name.
* Cell comparisons now work consistently, which fixes a bug where
  bounded_cell > point_cell compares the point to the bounds but,
  point_cell < bounded_cell compares the points.
* Fieldsfile import now correctly recognises pre v3.1 and post v5.2
  versions, which fixes a bug where the two were interchanged.
* iris.analysis.trajectory.interpolate now handles hybrid-height.

Incompatible changes
--------------------
* N/A

Deprecations
------------
* N/A

Release 1.0 (15 Oct, 2012)
==========================

Features added
--------------
* Iris can now represent hybrid-pressure vertical coordinates, and load
  them from GRIB files.
* Initial support for CF-style coordinate systems: lat-lon, rotated lat-lon,
  and transverse Mercator (incl. OSGB).
* Iris can now load NIMROD files.
* Availability of Cynthia Brewer colour palettes.
* Add a citation to a plot.
* Readability improvements to Cube summary.
* Ensures netCDF files are properly closed.
* A more explicit set of load functions, which also allow the automatic
  cube merging to be bypassed as a last resort.
* Save netCDF files with an unlimited dimension.
* The ability to project a cube with a lat-lon or rotated lat-lon coordinate
  system into a range of map projections e.g. Polar Stereographic.

Incompatible changes
--------------------
* The "source" and "history" metadata are now represented as Cube
  attributes, where previously they used coordinates.
* With the change to cartopy, the function iris.plot.gcm() is obsolete
  and has been removed.
* Three functions have been removed from iris.analysis.cartography:
  lat_lon_range(), get_lat_lon_grids(), and
  get_lat_lon_contiguous_grids(). They have been replaced with
  generalised versions: get_xy_grids()
  and get_xy_contiguous_bounded_grids().
* iris.plot.gcm, iris.plot.map_setup functions are now removed as part
  of the change to using cartopy. See the "what's new" section for further
  information on working with cartopy.
* The method `Cube.coord_dims()` now returns a tuple instead of a list.

Deprecations
------------
* The methods `Coord.cos()` and `Coord.sin()` have been deprecated.
* The function `load_strict()` has been deprecated. Code should now use
  `iris.load_cube()` and `iris.load_cubes()` instead.


----------------------------


Release 0.9 (14 Aug, 2012)
==========================
 
Features added
--------------
* Iris is now an open source project. See `Iris on github <https://github.com/SciTools/iris>`_.
* Hybrid vertical coordinates are implemented with the new :class:`~iris.aux_factory.AuxCoordFactory`.
* More graceful loading of units. See `here <https://github.com/SciTools/iris/pull/17>`_ for more details.
 
Incompatible changes
--------------------
* The Iris data model is now fully aligned with the `CF data model <http://cf-pcmdi.llnl.gov/documents/cf-conventions/>`_ .
  Iris remains file-format independent, as is the underlying CF data model.
* Cube merging has been re-written for the new CF data model with the benefit that some corner cases are now better handled. 
  Some users may find that their cubes, once merged, now have a smaller total shape and more intelligent handling of dimension coordinate picking.

Deprecations
------------
* None


----------------------------


Release 0.8 (29 May, 2012)
==========================
 
Features added
--------------
* Cube trajectory extraction now supports irregular grids (ORCA2) using nearest-neighbour interpolation.
* Support cube arithmetic with masked array data.
* PP loading now utilises improved field-code to standard_name/unit mapping.
* Upgraded to use centrally installed and managed version 2 of PP packing library.

Incompatible changes
--------------------
* The ability to add UK Met Office branding to plots has been moved to
  the UK Met Office's internal `monty` library.
* The ability to read colour palettes from the UKMO IDL library has been
  moved to the UK Met Office's internal `monty` library.
 
Deprecations
------------
* None


----------------------------


Release 0.7 (23 Mar, 2012)
==========================


Features added
--------------
* Cubes can now have missing data in the form of numpy masked arrays. All plotting and aggregating routines
  should now support masked data handling without any user code changes necessary.
* GRIB2 saving now supported for common cases. GRIB loading capabilities further extended.
* NetCDF loading of multidimensional auxiliary data implemented, providing initial support for data with an ORCA grid.
* Extended the number of PP STASH code to standard name mappings.
* PP saving of non ``latitude, longitude`` cubes added.
* Cube merging has been upgraded to support optimisation of ``time``, ``forecast_period`` and 
  ``forecast_reference_time`` dimensionality.
* Added new gallery entry highlighting NetCDF support for rotated pole data.
* NetCDF saving should now be CF-1.5 compliant.
* Custom made colour palettes from the UKMO IDL library can now be loaded as matplotlib colour
  palettes (see :func:`iris.clrtools.load_clr`).
* It is now possible to iterate over multiple cubes "in step", ensuring that the metadata is consistent between the 
  given cubes (see :func:`iris.iterate.izip`).
* Cell methods will now appear in the printout of a cube.
* Supporting software dependency versions have been updated. Of particular note is matplotlib which has gone from version 1.0.1
  up to `1.1.0 <http://matplotlib.sourceforge.net/users/whats_new.html#new-in-matplotlib-1-1>`_ . This may have a small impact on
  some plot element placements.  

Incompatible changes
--------------------
* The call signature for custom loader functions handled via :class:`~iris.io.format_picker.FormatSpecification` has changed.  
  Previously the signature was ``loader(filename, callback)`` and now looks like ``loader(filenames, callback)`` where ``filenames``
  is an iterable of filenames.
* Custom aggregators should now create :class:`iris.analysis.Aggregator` instances rather than defining 
  a the partial creation of an Aggregate (i.e. ``partial(iris.analysis.Aggregate, ...)`` becomes ``iris.analysis.Aggregator(...)``.
* PP STASH code ingestion is now stricter. In particular handling of partial stash codes (i.e. those without a model or section) 
  is no longer done, meaning that some cubes which previously had a standard name may no longer have a standard name. 
  Further work is planned to support field code translation which should provide more robust and accurate PP interpretations.
* For parity with the CF-NetCDF community 'phenomenon_time' has now become 'time'.

Deprecations
------------
* Callback functions to ``iris.load`` and ``iris.load_strict`` should no longer return a value.
  Updated documentation can be found at :func:`iris.load`.


----------------------------


Release 0.6 (20 Jan, 2012)
==========================

Features added
--------------
* The PP loader now supports PP fields with a header release number of 3.
  (As used by the UM version 8.1)

* Initial support for multidimensional coordinates (i.e. those which span multiple
  cube data dimensions) with the standard ExplicitCoord class.

* Added cube to CF-netCDF saving.

* Print of a cube now supports multi-dimensional coordinates, and re-categorisation of
  cube coordinates into "dimensioned", "scalar" and "other" (i.e. neither dimensioned or
  scalar).

* Provide support for CF-netCDF label variables and 1-D auxiliary coordinate variables.

Incompatible changes
--------------------
* The ``cube.coords`` dictionary has been replaced with the ``cube.coord`` and ``cube.coords`` methods 
  for easier identification of coordinates.
* ``iris.cdm.coords`` has been moved and separated to ``iris.coords and`` ``iris.coord_systems``.
* CF-netCDF global attributes are now put in the cube "attributes" dictionary rather than
  as scalar cube coordinates. Additionally any "unused" CF-netCDF variable attributes are also put in the 
  cube "attributes" dictionary.

Deprecations
------------
* ``cube.axes`` is now deprecated and read-only. A coordinate's dimensions on a cube can be  
  found with the ``cube.coord_dims`` method. An interim cube convenience property
  "axes" is provided to support legacy getter functionality.

* ``cube.axis_length`` is now deprecated. A cube's shape can be determined with ``cube.shape``
  and the dimensions to which a coordinate is associated can be determined with ``cube.coord_dims``.


----------------------------

Release 0.5 (31 Oct, 2011)
==========================

* Overhaul to NetCDF loading. Iris will now load a far wider variety of CF
  compliant NetCDF files.

* Cubes loaded from PP will now have the associated "STASH" code in MSI format
  within the cube custom "attributes" dictionary.

* Cubes now have an "attributes" dictionary which can be used for phenomenon
  definition - cubes with different attributes are representing fundamentally
  different phenomenon.

* Strings can now be used to constrain standard name on load/extract.

* Plotting routines now pick the colour palettes based on the cube to plot.

* Added ability to derive area weights from a shapely geometry.

* Cubes can now be operated on (added, multiplied, etc.) using numpy arrays.

* New example of how to load custom ascii files into Cubes.

* Percentile aggregation added.

* Deferred data loading for Cubes loaded from netCDF.

* Pickle support for cubes. Pickling should be reserved for short term storage and 
  optimisation purposes only as pickle files will not be compatible across releases.
